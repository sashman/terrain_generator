# scale, amount of detail per tile
# 0 = tile is smaller than a character, one tile represents part of an object, a tree make take up multiple tiles
# 1 = tile is around the size of a character, a tile represets one object present in it, e.g. tree per tile
# 2 = tile is  bigger than a character, a tile may hold multiple objects, but is constrained by the generator to represent only, e.g. a tile holding a tree would represent a group of trees, or one tile may hold an entire settlement in it
